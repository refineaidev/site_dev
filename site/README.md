## AriaDocs - Documentation Template

This feature-packed documentation template, built with Next.js, offers a sleek and responsive design, perfect for all your project documentation needs.

<br/>

### Quick Start

You can create a new Ariadocs project using the command:

```plaintext
npx create-aria-doc <project-directory>
```

### Expected Output

When you run the CLI, you can expect an output similar to this:

```
Creating a new Ariadocs project in /path/to/your/project from the master branch...
Cloning Master (Full Documentation)...
Ariadocs project successfully created in /path/to/your/project!

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies:
   // To support React 19, package maintainers will need to test and update their packages to include React 19 as a peer dependency. This is already in progress.
   npm install --force 
3. Start the development server:
   npm run dev
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```plaintext
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
